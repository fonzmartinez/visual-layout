    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The project presented is a database website dedicated to the top 80's movies from the decade.
      Users would be able to access details from the movie including the genre and director, as well
      create a favorites list on their own profile.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Purpose and Context</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the project was an exercise in the CareerFoundry web development course to
      teach and demonstrate working with javascript in full-stack development.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>The objective was to complete a working full-stack website that I could use to show my
      development in working with javascript and add to my portfolio.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Duration</h3>
    <p>The duration of the project took me nearly three weeks to complete. This was by far the longest
      I had worked on a project for my web development courses. Needing to complete project using both
      front-end and back-end technology along with different web languages and frameworks was time
      consuming.

    <h3>Steps Taken To Complete Project</h3>
    <p>Multiple steps were needed to create and complete a working app. While learning on how to
      work in javascript I was also introduced to so many different technologies to work with
      including API's, web server frameworks, databases, authentication, as so much more. From
      beginning with the client-side and ending with the server-side, this project showed me the
      complete blueprint on how a website is built.

    <h3>Final Results</h3>
    <p>For my very first complete web app building the client side and the server side, I was quite
      happy with my results. I will admit the overall look of the site could use some updates but my
      main goal during this project was to have a complete and working website. To have the website
      work as it was designed to was a big step for me and my confidence in web development.
